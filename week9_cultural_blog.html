<h1>Thinking Styles</h1>

<h3>Ever wonder what your thinking style is? You can find a quiz that will test for your Gregoric Thinking Style <a href = "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here.</a></h3>

<p>My thinking style is the Concrete Random thinking, meaning I am an experimentor. What I believe this means, is that I think about things by trying them out, usually starting with the simplest method, and disposing of thoughts that don't have purpose. This can be both an advantage and a set back. When approaching a problem, and starting with the simplest solution, I find that my code is normally quite DRY and to the point. In my case, this also means that when being presented by others with a complex solution, I often can't wrap my head around it without lots of research. By not being hung up on thoughts that don't pass my experimental thinking, I can quickly think through options for how to solve a challenge. But this also means, that I sometimes pass quickly through ideas that sometimes should be reconsidered. </p>


<p>When taking my thinking style into account when it comes to DBC, I hope that it will benefit me. Hopefully my simplistic ideas will allow me to write DRY code. I feel as if my biggest struggle in phase 0 of DBC has been more complex code. I will always start the solution with the most simplistic code I know, and when it passes a certain complexity, I have no ideas for how to solve the challenge. I'm hoping that as I learn more code and methods, I will be able to further my experimentation and not be so flustered by complex code.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I'm not convinced that this small quiz can sum up my thinking style in two words, but I did find that I could relate to the idea of concrete random thinking in some ways.</p>
