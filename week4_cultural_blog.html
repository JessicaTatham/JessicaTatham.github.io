<h1>Conflict</h1>
	<h2>The greatest conflicts are not between two people but between one person and himself.
~Garth Brooks </h2>

<ol>
	<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
		<p>I'm not a hugely confrontational person, which leads to very few conflicts in my life, except recently I've found myself in daily conflicts with the boys I nanny. The boys have had nannies their entire lives and therefore are well practiced in the art of defiance. Whether its about cleaning their rooms or doing their homework, you name it, we've butted heads about it. </p>
	<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
		<p> The true source of the conflict is that the boys are seeking attention. Both of their parents work long hours and have a hard time finding time for the kids. The results of this are that their children find any way they can to rebel. Unfortunatly, this manifests itself in refusing to do their homework.</p>
	<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
		<p>As a nanny, I really have no control in what the boys do or don't do. With no way to enforce disapline, ultimately, I just have to request that they do their work and insist that they clean their rooms. My most successful way of handling the conflict is making cookies and using it as an instentive to behave. Yes, this might be considered bribery, but what's a girl to do!!</p>
	<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
		<p>I have to take it day by day. Some days, we successfully talk about what they need to do and they arrange a deal with me where they can relax for half and hour and then work. When they're open for communication, we get along great and there is no conflict. It's the days when they refuse to even talk, that we run into problems.</p>
	<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
		<p>Possibly, not become a nanny ;) Just kidding! I love kids, but I know that I have a patience problem. Ultimately, I like things to be done quickly and efficiently. This doesn't go well with being a nanny. My own lack of patience is definitely a factor that contributes to our constent conflicts. If I was more patient and gave them time to rebel a little before I push the issue at hand, instead of insisting it get done now, I think the boys would be more open to listening to me. This also stems to their need for attention. By reacting to their acts of rebellion by insiting they do their homework, I am giving them that attention that they are wanting, even if its negative. I need to work harder on giving them more positive attention, so that maybe in the future they won't go out seeking the negative attention.</p>
	<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
		<p>I have learned that when it comes to kids, sometimes playing nice works, but when in doubt, take away the video games and all conflict is resolved!</p>
