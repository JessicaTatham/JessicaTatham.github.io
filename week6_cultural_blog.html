<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>


<p> Stereotype threat refers to <i>the experience of anxiety in a situation in which a person has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about his or her social group.</i> An example of this has been extensively researched by Claude Steele, in which he tested groups of mixed race teenagers using standardized tests that gave directions which highlighted negative stereotypes. The results of the exams showed a significant difference in test scores from the teenagers that took into account their race when taking the exams vs just taking the exam with no thought to their skin color.

</p>

<p>I believe that all of us have experienced a stereotype threat in some way or another. I for sure have felt the pressure of my stereotype. I am a 22 year old girl. At this time in my life, all of my friends are either getting married, or getting crazy drunk every night of the week. At family events, everyone is constantly asking me about my love life or my social life or why I don't seem to have any of the above. How has this led to negative effects you may ask? I sometimes feel like as a 22 year old girl, I am failing. If I'm not drinking at a social event, or going on a date every friday night, something must be wrong with me! Not to mention, the anxiety that comes when I do go out and feel like I have to act a certain way or do certain things just because that is what 22 year old girls are supposed to do. 

</p>

<p>All of us have this desire to fit in and belong and we look to those in our same social group to show us how to achieve this. But those social groups come with stereotypes that our social media and environment tends to push on us. Stereotype threat is personnal, it's not about everyone pushing the stereotype on you, it's about you punishing yourself because of a specific stereotype that you are linked too. 

</p>


<p>I believe that the best way to combat stereotype threat is to gain a strong sense of self. As we grow confidence in who we are as people, and embrace our individual personalities, we will be able to look at stereotypes that might exist about us and laugh, because we know we are more than just a stupid stereotype.
