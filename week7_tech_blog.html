<h1>SQL vs. NoSQL</h1>

<h2>SQL databases</h2>

<p>So far, while studying SQL this week, I've found it to be easy and user friendly. Here are a few key features about SQL:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Relational Database</li>
	<li>Table based: SQL stores its data in tables that consist of rows and columns of data.</li>
	<li>Vertically scalable</li>
	<li>SQL databases use stuctured query language to define and manipulate data.</li>
	<li>SQL is best used for complex query iintensice enviroments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NoSQL databases</h2>

<p>I have not yet used a NoSQL database, but from my research, I have found that it is extremely different from SQL. Here are some key fetures about NoSQL:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-Relational Database</li>
	<li>Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide column stores: This allows NoSQL databases to not have to adhere to standard schema definitions</li>
	<li>Horizontally scalable</li>
	<li>NoSQL focuses on the collection of documents.</li>
	<li>NoSQL is not a good fit for complex queries, but rather for large traffic horizonally scalable databases. </li>
</ul>

<p>Both SQL and NoSQL have their places within the database world, it's just a matter of choosing which one will suit your purposes.</p>
<p>I got most of my information for this blog post from thegeekstuff.com.</p>
