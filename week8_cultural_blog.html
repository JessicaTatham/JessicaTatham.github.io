<h1>Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>

<h2>What is DevBootCamp?</h2>

<p>
DevBootCamp, DBC, is essentially a 18 week intensive course on the Ruby Programming language. The first 9 weeks are completed at home, learning the basics of Ruby, as well as the very basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and SQL. The last 9 weeks are spent onsite, where you continue your learning of Ruby with the aid of teachers, mentors, and your peers in your cohort.  
</br>
As Karim Bishay, the founder of DBC, explains in this <a href = "http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside chat</a>, DBC is an experiment. As most people are slowly figuring out, the university system is majorly flawed. What once was the best way of preparing yourself for a successful and fullfilling future, is now mearly an overpriced and poorly executed system. Most of us come out of college without usable, employable skills and a bucketload of student debt. DevBootcamp is a program that is offering an alternative education. One in which you spend your time aquiring this extremely useful skill that is in high demand. 
</br>
Still being an experiment, it is up to everyone, teachers, mentors, and students, to mold DevBootCamp into what they want it to be. Karim talks about his Kitchen vs. Restaraunt analogy. DBC could be a restaraunt in which you enter, sit at the table, order what you want, and expect someone to provide exactly that. Or, DBC could be the kitchen, where you put on your apron, decide what you should cook, fix what needs fixing, work together, and take ownership of DBC and your experience in it. 
</br>
With the chefs in the kitchen mindset, students should exit DBC being a first class learner, with a great start on their way to becoming a Ruby programmer.

<h2>Why am I doing DevBootCamp?</h2>

<p>When I first decided that I wanted to be a programmer, I attempted to go about learning everything on my own through online tutorials, and videos. But everytime I would run into a problem, I would have to spend the next two hours googling how to fix it. It wasn't that I minded the problem solving, but while I was also working, somtimes 2 hours was all the time I had for studying that day, and this undoubtably led to very little progress in my goal of becoming a programmer. Enter my discovery of DBC. Here was a course that I could whole-heartedly get behind. When researching the program, there where 3 main points that really convinced me of the program. 
<ul>
	<li>First, it is intensive. Your days are spent from sun up to late into the night, immersed in learning to code. This really spoke well to me, as I am not someone who likes to waste my time when I have a goal I want to accomplish. </li>
	<li>Second is that DBC doesn't just teach you Ruby, but also gives you a good start on HTML/CSS, Javascript, and SQL. When I was looking up potential future jobs as a junior ruby developer, the main thing I noticed was that employers want you to have a basic understanding of several programming languages, and to be well rounded in your knowledge of coding.</li>
	<li>Third, was the fact that DBC doesn't make any false promises. They were very direct in what you are getting yourself into. No, they won't find you a job once you are finished, but yes, they do prepare you so that you are more than able to get yourself a job, and they give multiple opportunities for you to meet potential employers in the developer field. No, you won't come out of DBC as a full fledged ruby developer, but yes, you will come out with enough skills that someone will be willing to employ you to keep learning Ruby. Then finally, no, DBC isn't easy, but yes, it will be worth all the hardwork.</li>
</ul>
</br>
For all these reasons, and more, I am very happy that I have chosen to go through DevBootcamp, and I am excited to get started in New York in 2 weeks! That being said, the nerves are starting to creep in and I can defintely relate to Karim's imposter theory, where I won't be as good as the others in my cohort, or I wasn't supposed to be chosen for DBC, but those are fears that I believe that everyone has, and that I will just have overcome as I dive into learning to be a Ruby developer. Hopefully, putting my faith into DevBootCamp will end up being the best decision I could ever make :)
