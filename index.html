<strong>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, </br>
And sorry I could not travel both</br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could</br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth; </br>
</br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,</br>
And having perhaps the better claim</br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,</br>
Though as for that the passing there</br>
Had worn them really about the same,</br>
</br>
And both that morning equally lay</br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.</br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day! </br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way</br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</br>
</br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh</br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:</br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,</br>
I took the one less traveled by,</br>
And that has made all the difference. </br>
