<h1>Functional Programming vs. Object-Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>Ruby is mostly considered to be an object-oriented programming language, although it has been debated that it still untilizes some practices used in Functional programming. Since I am still a newby in programming and don't really have enough background to make a educated arguement either way, I thought I would give you guys an idea about what each programming type is all about. </p> 


<p>Object-Oriented Programming:
OOP utilizes methods and classes in its codes in order to create objects that have various properties while the object is in its given state. The output of a program can vary based on how it is processed through the methods.  

Simple Example of OOP code:

<img src = "math.png"/>

As you can see, depending on whether you are utilizing the add method or subtract method, your output will vary. 
</p>

<p>Functional Programming:
Functional Programming can best be described as a concept which models mathmatical functions. FP has no objects or 'states', its output has no variation or side effects. 

Example: I don't have any experience using functional programming, so I stole an example from a <a href = "http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/9730/functional-programming-vs-oop">website</a>.
